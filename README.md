# Proof of Meditation

Proof of Meditation is an app that incentivizes you to meditate and rewards you for your effort.

## Problem

DAO contributors can organize their working hours independently. This gives them freedom, but that also often results in even more working hours than in a ‘normal’ job. As a result, time for self-care comes short.

## Vision

We believe that taking time to be zen and meditate is as valuable as getting your work done and that working on yourself should be rewarded.

## Mission

Everyone profits from meditation because it clears your mind and enables you to make better decisions. Many people want to meditate, but it’s hard to implement the habit and regularly commit time.
Proof of Meditation uses incentive structures to help people stick to their meditation goals.

## How it works

a) Stake your meditation
There are cohort-based learning cycles of 21 days. At the 1st of each month, a new cohort starts, and participants decide upon their meditation goal for the next 21 days. You can choose to meditate 10 Minutes per day. Then you stake this goal with tokens.
Each day you miss a meditation, a percentage of your staked tokens are being locked into a pool of that cohort.
After 21 days, every participant receives back the tokens for the successful meditation sessions. The pooled tokens are being distributed between the people who didn’t miss any meditation during the 21 days. If no one made it without missing a meditation, the group could donate the pooled money. If everyone succeeds, there will be an extra reward (has to be defined).

b) Fitbit data
The app will use Fitbit data as ‘proof’ of the meditation.
We know that every meditation is unique, and we don’t want to prescribe what is good or bad meditation. Nevertheless, Fitbits can provide a method to measure the heart rate during meditation, and it will be possible to see differences.

c) NFTs
Participants will receive a unique NFT for each meditation, artistically displaying the heart rate data during each session. Over time, you can see how the data evolves. By filling in some additional data after each meditation, e.g., the mood, the NFTs can have different colors, and thereby you can see the evolution of your data easily and in one place.

Additionally to the single NFTs, participants will receive a generative NFT that changes after each meditation session. It will display the overall process by adding new characteristics.

## DAO tooling

DAOs can use Proof of Meditation as a tool for rewarding mental health care with small portions of extra vowing power for those who meditated the most.

## Impact

a) Impact on personal health and progress:

b) Social impact:
There will be the possibility to donate part or all of the rewards you get for your mediation for verified projects of [Giveth](https://giveth.io).

## Further ideas

We are planning to integrate a peer to peer proof mechanism to provide another option to prove your meditation. Fitbit users are advanced users, but in the future we want to enable anyone to participate in the meditation cohorts.

How can a peer to peer proof of meditation look like?
There might be trusted validators, who are not themselves in the current cohort, but have already completed minimum one full meditation cycle. Problems rise with the question how validators can prove the meditation of others.
