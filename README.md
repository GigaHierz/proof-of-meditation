# Proof of Meditation

This app is being built to incentivize people to take more care of their health and emotional wellbeing through meditation.
The user will use their fitbit data to prove that they are doing the meditation.

The business model will looks like this:

The user will pay upfront a certain amount of money (100$/20 days) with the promise that they will get it back if they meditate everyday + a bonus.

for each day the user doesn't meditate, 5$ will be deducted from the returned money. If the user meditates less than 10 days, they will not receive any money back.

Also each day the user meditates, they will get an NFT created out of the heartrate of the user.

OR FEATURE: when the user signs up, they will get an empty / blank NFT. Which will be a dynamic NFT that
